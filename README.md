OpenMP and Mandelbrot Set
-------------------------
This project experiment OpenMP programming for counting the total sum of complex points that fall under a Mandelbrot Set. The objective is to achieve the maximum speedup possible.

This assignment work is done for COMP90025 Project 1A assessment 2016 SM2, The University of Melbourne. You can read [the report](SanKhoLin_829463_COMP90025_Project1A_Report.pdf). You may also want to read the related [`mpi-mandelbrot`](https://github.com/victorskl/mpi-mandelbrot) assignment. The implementation still has room for improvement. You may wish to cite this work as follow.
